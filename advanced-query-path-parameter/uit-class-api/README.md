there are two ways to communicate with frontend 
1)request
2)respone

1)<!-- we can send any kind of the data in the response but we mostly follow our standards If we are using RestAPI we must respone in Json format unlike we can send data in any format like and file string ,booleon,int ,etc. -->


2)
